# Data Type Primitives
## Current Data Types
1. ```int``` is a 64 bit signed integer value
2. ```float``` is a 64 bit signed floating point value
3. ```byte``` is a 8 bit signed integer value. Functionally the same as a ```char``` in C
4. ```bool``` is a boolean value that is either ```true``` or ```false```

## Future Data Types
- Arrays: eventually there will be arrays of each data type
- Classes: classes will be the same as a ```struct``` in C, except you can attach member functions to it. There will NOT be inheritance
- String: MAYBE. This could either be a language primitive or a class based around byte[]

## Type Coercion or Implicit Type Casting
Type casting will be done similarly to C using a data structure hierarchy.
The hierarchy is in the same order as listed above
